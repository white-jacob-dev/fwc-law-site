                                        <p><strong>Problems with generic online forms:</strong></p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Fail to account for Michigan-specific laws and requirements</li>
                                            <li>Don't address your unique family dynamics or asset types</li>
                                            <li>Can result in unintended beneficiaries or assets unnecessarily passing through probate</li>
                                            <li>Often lead to family disputes and costly litigation</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p><strong>Additional risks with AI-generated documents:</strong></p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>AI "hallucinations"—confidently generating legal provisions that don't exist or citing fictitious court cases</li>

                                            <li>May create trusts that conflict with Michigan law or include incorrect tax provisions</li>

                                            <li>Failing to properly fund a trust—leaving assets titled in your name that must go through probate anyway</li>
                                            <li>Using outdated or boilerplate language that doesn't reflect current Michigan law</li>
                                            <li>Overlooking beneficiary designations on retirement accounts and life insurance that override your will or trust</li>
                                            <li>Creating ambiguous distribution provisions that lead to disputes among heirs</li>
                                            <li>Missing critical tax planning opportunities or triggering unnecessary estate taxes</li>
                                            <li>Drafting powers of attorney that banks and financial institutions refuse to accept</li>
                                            <li>Failing to coordinate your estate plan with your business succession plan</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <ul>

                                        <p><strong>A boutique firm with focused expertise:</strong></p>
                                        <ul>

                                            <li>Unlike general practice firms that dabble in many areas, our attorneys have deep, specialized knowledge in this field</li>

                                        </ul>
                                        
                                        <p><strong>We see both sides:</strong></p>
