                            <p class="lead">Mara Kent (she/her/hers) is a life-long resident of Ann Arbor. Her practice areas include estate planning, probate and trust administration, wealth planning, advanced wealth and tax planning, elder law and long-term care planning, special needs planning, estate planning for surrogacy and assisted reproduction, same-sex parental confirmations, adult and step-parent adoptions, and prenuptial agreements.</p>
                            
                            <p>Mara loves making personal connections with her clients, doing what she generally considers to be "happy law." Mara counsels her clients on how to plan for major life events by anticipating common (and not-so-common) problems before they arise, so her clients can strategize about how to minimize court involvement, family conflict, added expense, and stress. She helps clients plan for their future care and the care of loved ones, as well as assists clients in establishing a plan for the distribution of their estate after they die.</p>
                            
                            <p>While in law school, Mara worked in the Office of General Counsel for Ford Motor Company and went on to distinction as a law clerk for former Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Michael F. Cavanagh from 1996-1998.</p>
                            
                            <p>From 2000–2014, Mara was a tenured professor at the Thomas M. Cooley Law School where she taught contract law, commercial sales, negotiable instruments, and legal research & writing, and she remains a Senior Professor Emerita. She has been doing what she loves in private practice since 2014.</p>
                            
                            <p>She, her spouse, and their daughters are proud University of Michigan alumni. When she is not working or volunteering, Mara enjoys creating art, doing home improvement projects, running or walking, gardening, and being outdoors with their dog Scout. Mara is an ally of the LGBTQ+ community and a proud supporter of her friends and clients who are of diverse racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and religious backgrounds.</p>
