                        <p class="lead">A prenuptial agreement isn't about planning for divorce—it's about open communication, mutual understanding, and protecting both partners' interests. At Ferguson Widmayer & Clark PC, we help couples create fair, enforceable agreements that provide clarity and peace of mind.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Why Consider a Prenuptial Agreement?</h2>
                        <p>Prenuptial agreements serve many purposes beyond protecting assets. They encourage important conversations about finances, expectations, and goals before marriage, and provide a clear framework for handling financial matters during the marriage.</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Protect Separate Property:</strong> Clearly define which assets each spouse brings into the marriage and will retain as separate property.</li>
                            <li><strong>Business Interests:</strong> Protect family businesses or professional practices from division in the event of divorce.</li>
                            <li><strong>Family Wealth:</strong> Preserve inherited assets or family wealth for future generations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Debt Protection:</strong> Shield each spouse from the other's pre-existing debts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Second Marriages:</strong> Protect children from prior relationships and clarify inheritance rights.</li>
                            <li><strong>Financial Clarity:</strong> Establish clear expectations about financial responsibilities during marriage.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h2>What Can Be Addressed</h2>
                        <p>Michigan law allows prenuptial agreements to address a wide range of financial and property matters, subject to certain limitations.</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Property Division:</strong> How assets and debts will be divided if the marriage ends.</li>
                            <li><strong>Spousal Support:</strong> Whether alimony will be paid and under what circumstances.</li>
                            <li><strong>Property Rights:</strong> Rights to own, manage, transfer, and dispose of property during marriage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Death Benefits:</strong> Rights to death benefits from life insurance or retirement plans.</li>
                            <li><strong>Estate Planning:</strong> Coordination with wills and trusts to ensure consistent treatment of assets.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h2>Creating an Enforceable Agreement</h2>
                        <p>For a prenuptial agreement to be enforceable in Michigan, it must meet certain requirements. We ensure your agreement is properly drafted and executed.</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Voluntary Execution:</strong> Both parties must enter the agreement freely, without coercion or duress.</li>
                            <li><strong>Full Disclosure:</strong> Complete disclosure of assets, debts, income, and financial obligations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Independent Counsel:</strong> Each party should have the opportunity to consult with their own attorney.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fair Terms:</strong> The agreement should not be unconscionable at the time of enforcement.</li>
                            <li><strong>Proper Timing:</strong> Sufficient time before the wedding to review, negotiate, and consider the agreement.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h2>Postnuptial Agreements</h2>
                        <p>Already married? Postnuptial agreements allow married couples to address many of the same issues covered by prenuptial agreements; however, they may face more scrutiny from a court than a prenuptial agreement because the agreement was not reached prior to the marriage. A postnuptial agreement can be valuable when circumstances change or when couples want to formalize financial arrangements during their marriage, but you should seek legal counsel about their enforceability in Michigan.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                        <p>We understand the sensitive nature of prenuptial agreements. Our attorneys work to create balanced agreements that protect both parties while preserving the relationship. We encourage open dialogue and help you address difficult topics in a constructive manner.</p>

                                <p>Yes, prenuptial agreements are generally enforceable in Michigan if they meet certain requirements. The agreement must be in writing, signed by both parties, entered into voluntarily without coercion, and include full disclosure of assets and debts. The terms cannot be unconscionable at the time of enforcement. Courts may refuse to enforce agreements that were signed under pressure or without adequate time for review. A court may hold the power to set aside all or a portion of a prenuptial agreement that it feels is inequitable. It is important to seek legal counsel prior to entering into a prenuptial agreement.</p>

                                <p>We recommend beginning the process as early as possible, but with a recommended 3-4 months before your wedding at a minimum if possible. This allows time for both parties to meet with their own attorneys to review the agreement, negotiate any changes, and sign without feeling rushed. Agreements signed days before a wedding may be challenged as coerced. Starting early also allows for thoughtful discussions about finances and expectations without the stress of an approaching deadline. Please note that all of the attorneys in our office who do prenuptial agreements are scheduling appointments several weeks to months in advance, so it is important to reach out to schedule your appointment as soon as possible. If your fiancée does not have an independent attorney, we can provide you with a list of reputable attorneys whom they may wish to interview.</p>

                                <p>While not legally required, having independent legal counsel for each party significantly strengthens the enforceability of the agreement. It demonstrates that both parties understood the terms and entered the agreement voluntarily. If one attorney represents both parties, there's a conflict of interest, and the agreement may be more vulnerable to challenge. We can recommend qualified attorneys for the other party to consult. At Ferguson Widmayer & Clark, we feel strongly that each party needs their own attorney; therefore, we require this in order to complete the prenuptial agreement.</p>
