                        <h2>Elder Abuse & Exploitation</h2>

                            <span>What is the difference between Medicare and Medicaid?</span>

                                <p>Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people 65+ (and some younger people with disabilities). It covers hospital stays, doctor visits, and some skilled nursing care, but NOT long-term custodial care. Medicaid is a joint federal-state program for people with limited income and assets. In Michigan, Medicaid can pay for long-term nursing home care and some home care services. Many people use both programs together.</p>

                                <p>Medicaid planning strategies may include: irrevocable trusts established outside the 5-year look-back period, spousal protection rules that allow the healthy spouse to retain significant assets, converting countable assets to exempt assets (like paying off a mortgage), purchasing an annuity that provides income to a spouse, and Lady Bird deeds for real estate. Planning should begin as early as possible, but options exist even in crisis situations.</p>

                                <p>A Lady Bird deed (enhanced life estate deed) allows you to keep full control of your property during your lifetime—including the right to sell, mortgage, or revoke the deed—while automatically transferring the property to beneficiaries upon your death without probate. Importantly for Medicaid planning, the property passes outside the estate, potentially avoiding Medicaid estate recovery. It's a powerful tool for protecting the family home.</p>

                                <p>You can avoid the need for a guardianship or conservatorship with validly executed powers of attorney in most circumstances. However, a guardianship or conservatorship may be necessary when a loved one no longer has the mental capacity to sign legal documents or make safe decisions for themselves due to dementia, mental illness, developmental disability, or other conditions. Signs of potential incapacity include inability to manage finances, refusing necessary medical care, being exploited by others, or engaging in behavior that puts them at risk. Guardianships and conservatorships are court-supervised arrangements and should be considered a last resort after other, less restrictive options have been exhausted.</p>

                                <p>The ideal time to plan is 5+ years before you anticipate needing care, primarily because Medicaid has a 5-year "look-back" period for asset transfers. However, planning is valuable at any stage. Even if long-term care is imminent, there are crisis planning strategies available. If you're in good health, focus on long-term care insurance, powers of attorney, and revocable trusts. If care needs are approaching, consult with an elder law attorney about all available options.</p>
